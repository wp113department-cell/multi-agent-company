## Fleet OS Health

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| capability_registry | ✅ 67 agents registered | All Day 1–6 batches confirmed via live import + registry inspection (not just doc claims) |
| agent_registry | ✅ SLEEP/IDLE/RUNNING states wired | `complete_task()` → AgentState.SLEEP after every run; sleep-wiring regression from `dc27e1e` fixed 2026-07-20 |
| Event bus | ✅ 8 typed events | TaskCreated, TaskStarted, TaskCompleted, TaskFailed, ReviewRequested, LessonPublished, HealthUpdated, MemoryCreated |
| fleet_checkpoint | ✅ save/restore/rollback + trace_id | trace_id stored in metadata |
| Fleet OS flags (20 capabilities) | ✅ All default True in base_graph.py | enable_planning, enable_memory, enable_reflection, enable_lesson |
| memory_hook_node repo-context injection | ✅ FIXED 2026-07-20 | Was calling a nonexistent `scanner.build_repo_index` (real name: `index_repository`), silently swallowed by a broad except — capability #15 (Architecture Awareness) never actually fired until this fix |
| Role prompts (v2.0: 11-section global + 7 role-specific) | ✅ 67/67 files verified | Superset of the plan's original 9-section template — see Day 8 note below |
| **P1 Activity Stream UI** | ✅ Day 5A complete | SSE streaming: thinking/tool_call/file_edit/terminal events + Stop+Resume |
| **P2 Model Router** | ✅ Day 5A complete | `agent_models.json` covers all 68 names; wired into `run_agent_graph()` |
| **P3 Repo Console** | ✅ Day 5A complete | Clone→Work→Push web console; `git_service.py`; workspace scoping |
| Groq test shim | ✅ TEMPORARY, isolated | `USE_GROQ=true` in `.env` is for local manual/dev-server use only; `tests/conftest.py` forces `USE_GROQ=false` for the unit suite (fixed 2026-07-20 — was silently making real network calls for ~2000 tests) |
| **Fleet Enhancement Dashboard** | ✅ Day 9 complete | `enhancement_requests` table + `app/api/fleet_dashboard.py` + `/fleet` page + background scan loop (`FLEET_SCAN_INTERVAL_HOURS`) |
| **RunMetrics real-data wiring** | ✅ Day 10 complete | Found `_span.__enter__()` return value discarded since Day 0 — no run had ever populated tokens/cost/verification/tool_calls. Fixed in `base_graph.py`; verified with `test_metrics_wiring.py` |
| **Budget manager** | ✅ Day 10 complete | `app/fleet/budget_manager.py` — two-tier per-run + daily cumulative enforcement, wired into `run_agent_graph()` post-graph section |
| **Benchmark manager** | ✅ Day 10 + gap-closure | `app/fleet/benchmark_manager.py` — 7 objectives, Postgres-backed baselines (`agent_benchmarks` table, migration 012), regression detection. Gap-closure 2026-07-21: `store_baseline()` was never called automatically anywhere — added `_benchmark_baseline_loop()` in `main.py` so real agents actually get baselines over time |
| **Prompt registry** | ✅ Day 11 complete | `app/fleet/prompt_registry.py` — versioned role prompts (`prompt_versions` table, migration 013), draft→in_review→approved→deployed→superseded, regression-gated deploy, disk-writes to `backend/roles/*.md` |
| **Regression detector** | ✅ Day 11 complete | `app/fleet/regression_detector.py` — thin deploy-time gate wrapping Day 10's `benchmark_manager.compare_to_baseline()` |
| **Tool discovery** | ✅ Day 10 + gap-closure | `app/fleet/tool_discovery.py` — thin index over `tool_manifest.py` + `capability_registry.py`. Gap-closure 2026-07-21: never consulted anywhere — added opt-in `verify_tool_availability` to `fleet_manager.select()`, enabled at its real call site in `run_manager()` |
| **Versioned memory** | ✅ Day 11 + gap-closure | `app/fleet/versioned_memory.py` — `versioned_lessons` table (migration 014), merge-on-conflict lesson lifecycle (DRAFT→PUBLISHED→SUPERSEDED/MERGED_INTO→ARCHIVED). Gap-closure 2026-07-21: `publish()` was never called from `_extract_and_store_lesson()` (the exact site Day 11's plan doc named) — wired in, gated on a real `VOYAGE_API_KEY`; `archive_expired()` now runs via a real daily background loop in `main.py` |
| **E2E pipeline smoke test** | ✅ Day 12 complete | `tests/test_day12_smoke_test.py` — POST /tasks → run → pipeline pause → approve → launch_manager, previously zero coverage |
| **Failure Recovery Ladder** | ✅ Day 12 complete | `app/fleet/failure_ladder.py` — all 7 states runnable; wired into `run_manager()`'s existing retry loop + `base_graph.py`'s stall path |
| **Event compliance** | ✅ Day 12 complete | `tests/test_event_compliance.py` — static AST scan, only the 8 canonical `FleetEventType`s ever emitted |
| **Hierarchy chain (partial)** | ✅ Day 12 complete | `fleet_manager.select()` + `agent_bus.publish(task_created)` now actually called from `run_manager()` — previously registered-but-unused; "knowledge_graph" step doesn't exist as a module, excluded |
| **Human Approval UI** | ✅ Day 13 complete | `app/fleet/approval_gate.py` + `pending_approvals` table (migration 015) + `/api/approvals/*` + `apps/web/app/approvals/page.tsx` — generic layer wired to `pipeline/graph.py`'s real interrupt(); found + fixed a Day-0 bug where plan rejection was never a valid status transition |
| **Git Push Workflow** | ✅ Day 14 complete | `app/tools/git_push_tool.py` (PR creation via real GitHub REST API) + `DevTask.branch_name/pr_url/pr_status` (migration 016) + `git_push` approvals registered into Day 13's `pending_approvals` + `GET/POST /api/tasks/{id}/pr,/push` + PR-link section on the task detail page. Found + fixed a Day-0 bug: agent code changes were never committed to the worktree branch, meaning the Reviewer's diff review had been reviewing nothing since Day 0 |

## Open Issues

- [ ] mypy `--strict`: 32 pre-existing errors, 0 new. 18 in `app/repo_tools/browser_driver.py` (predates Fleet Days, unrelated to fleet work). 7 in `base_graph.py` (LangGraph `StateGraph` generic/overload typing — known library-stub limitation). Remainder scattered (`tools.py`, `agent_result.py`, `audit_log.py`, `config.py`, `jwt.py`).
- [ ] 55 skipped tests (pre-existing — unbuilt frontend features) + 17 deselected (real-LLM Groq tests, rate-limited on free tier, pending until `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` available — see memory `pending_anthropic_tests`).
- [ ] Fleet work has been happening directly on `main` rather than the plan's prescribed `fleet-enhancement-day0` branch (Pre-Day 0A). Process deviation, not a functional bug — flagged for awareness, not blocking.

| Day 6 | ~2026-07-18/19 | — | 17 agents + groq_adapter AGENT_CONTRACT batch |
| v2.0 Role Prompts | 2026-07-20 | 2260 | DRY `_GLOBAL_STANDARDS.md` + 7 role-specific sections, all 67 files |
| **Full Audit + Gap-Closure** | **2026-07-20** | **2254/2254, 0 failed** | Found + fixed 11 real gaps (see PROJECT.md session log): chat_agent migration, groq_adapter registration, Groq-bypass regression + test-network-leak, repo-context injection bug, duplicate capability tags, test-order pollution, ReviewResult reload bug, chat_agent background-process bug, 13 mypy fixes |
| **Day 7 — VerificationConfig Hardening** | **2026-07-20** | **2254/2254** | 0 empty configs (except legitimate executive/manager), 0 duplicate tags, 0 dead enforce keys, 0 `verify_agent_contract()` violations |
| **Day 8 — Role Prompt Verification** | **2026-07-20** | **2399/2399** | Read roo-code's prompt-section pattern first (REPO-FIRST); verified all 9 plan-required sections present (verbatim/near-verbatim) in `_GLOBAL_STANDARDS.md`; wrote 145 new durable tests (`test_day8_role_prompts.py`) — 0 prior test coverage existed for role-prompt structure |
| **Day 9 — Fleet Enhancement Dashboard** | **2026-07-21** | **2479/2479** | 5 self-improvement agents (scan/apply two-phase) + `enhancement_requests` DB table + approve/reject API + background scan loop + `/fleet` dashboard page. Found + fixed 5 real bugs (2 pre-existing: `MemoryEmbedding.created_at` missing from ORM despite being a real column; 3 self-introduced: duplicate field caught by mypy, a timezone-column mismatch, and a repeat of the Day 7 asyncio-loop-reuse bug in new tools). Verified end-to-end against the real backend+frontend+Postgres stack, not just mocks |
| **Day 10 — budget_manager + benchmark_manager + tool_discovery** | **2026-07-21** | **2517/2517** | Found + fixed the foundational bug first: `RunMetrics` had never been populated by any run since Day 0 (`_span.__enter__()` return value discarded in `base_graph.py`). Then built `tool_discovery.py` (index over existing registries), `budget_manager.py` (two-tier per-run + daily enforcement, wired into `run_agent_graph()`), `benchmark_manager.py` (7 objectives, Postgres-backed baselines via new `agent_benchmarks` table/migration 012, regression detection). Added a real `reflection_unsatisfied_count` signal to close the hallucination_rate objective properly rather than stub it. 0 new mypy errors |
| **Day 11 — prompt_registry + regression_detector + versioned_memory** | **2026-07-21** | **2544/2544** | REPO-FIRST research first (roo-code, langgraph, swe-agent, autogen, open-hands, aider) found all 3 modules are novel designs — no repo has an approval-gate prompt lifecycle, baseline-regression blocking, or merge-on-conflict memory. `regression_detector.py` wraps Day 10's `benchmark_manager` instead of reimplementing comparison logic. `prompt_registry.py` (new `prompt_versions` table, migration 013) writes approved versions straight to `backend/roles/*.md` — zero changes needed to `load_role()`. `versioned_memory.py` (new `versioned_lessons` table, migration 014) reuses `app.memory.store._embed()` for conflict detection and does a real LLM merge call on conflict. Corrected a wrong plan-doc assumption (no `lessons` DB table existed) before building. Found + fixed a real bug in `rollback()` returning stale pre-flip state. 0 new mypy errors |
| **Day 12 — E2E Smoke Test + Failure Ladder + Event Compliance + Hierarchy Chain** | **2026-07-21** | **2569/2569** | Found the real pipeline flow (`POST /tasks→run→approve→launch_manager`) had zero test coverage anywhere, despite being fully wired — closed with `test_day12_smoke_test.py`. Found `fleet_manager`/`capability_registry`/`agent_bus` were registered-but-never-called from the live path — added additive `fleet_manager.select()` + `publish(task_created(...))` calls into `run_manager()`. Built `failure_ladder.py` (all 7 recovery states): closed a real gap where `VALID_TRANSITIONS` had an unreachable `"failed"` status; wired retry-exhaustion into `run_manager()`'s existing bounded retry loop rather than adding a second, riskier one inside `base_graph.py`'s hot path. Static AST event-compliance scan + hierarchy-chain integration test (6 real steps verified against 2 real integration points, not 1 imagined chain). 0 new mypy errors |
| **Day 13 — Human Approval UI** | **2026-07-21** | **2583/2583** | Verified LangGraph 1.2.7's real interrupt()/resume semantics empirically (node bodies re-run from the top on resume) before designing anything. Built a generic approvals system (`pending_approvals` table/migration 015, `approval_gate.py`, `/api/approvals/*`, frontend page) wired to the one real, resumable-from-cold interrupt() call site (`pipeline/graph.py`) rather than retrofitting the 72-agent `base_graph.py` hot path. Found + fixed two real bugs: (1) sync `asyncio.run()` facades called from already-async pipeline code failed silently — added async variants; (2) a genuine Day-0 bug where rejecting a plan during the approval pause has always raised `TransitionError` (`"planning"→"rejected"` was never valid) — found by the first test that ever exercised the reject path. Verified frontend with a real production build + live backend/frontend dev servers. 0 new mypy errors |
| **Gap-Closure — Days 11-13** | **2026-07-21** | **2596/2596** | Independent audit (user-requested, before Day 14) checking whether every Day 10-13 module is actually CALLED by real code, not just built and tested in isolation — found the same "registered but unused" pattern Day 12 already found once, recurring in `versioned_memory.publish()` (never wired into the exact call site Day 11's own plan named), `versioned_memory.archive_expired()` (never wired into `main.py`'s lifespan despite the plan saying it would be), and `benchmark_manager.store_baseline()` (never called automatically, making `prompt_registry.deploy()`'s regression gate a permanent no-op). Fixed all 3 plus `tool_discovery.py` (never consulted — added opt-in `verify_tool_availability` to `fleet_manager.select()`) and a Day 13 `pending_approvals` restart edge case. Found + fixed a SECOND real bug while fixing the first: unconditionally wiring `versioned_memory.publish()` into the lesson-extraction hot path broke 3 of Day 11's OWN tests via shared-table contamination — caught by running the full suite, not just the new tests in isolation. 0 new mypy errors |
| **Day 14 — Git Push Workflow** | **2026-07-22** | **2633/2633** | REPO-FIRST research (open-hands PR-creation shape, aider commit-attribution) before any design. Found a real Day-0 bug first: agent code was never committed to the worktree branch, so the Reviewer's diff review had been reviewing nothing since Day 0 — fixed by adding a `git_add`+`git_commit` step in `run_manager()`'s retry loop (reusing Day 5A's `git_service.py`). Built `git_push_tool.py` (real GitHub REST API PR creation via `httpx`), `DevTask.branch_name/pr_url/pr_status` (migration 016), and wired `git_push` approvals into Day 13's existing `pending_approvals` system rather than a parallel one — exactly as Day 13's own closing note anticipated. Corrected the plan's `qa_node`-in-`pipeline/graph.py` assumption (that flow is actually `manager.py`'s plain-async `launch_manager()`), mirroring the same class of plan/reality correction found in Days 12-13. Found a new asyncio shared-engine hazard variant (production code correctly using the shared `get_session_factory()` singleton fails under bare `asyncio.run()` from sync tests) and a real mypy bug (discriminated-union narrowing defeated by `getattr()` in a list comprehension) — both fixed. 0 new mypy errors (11 found and fixed) |
